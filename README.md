I'm a student of programming and data engineering who lives in Brazil interested in cloud computing, data science and related areas.
During the last decade i have been working as a journalist and filmmaker/motion designer. After the Covid-19 pandemic i discovered a new passion for computer science and decided to dive into this whole new world in my life.
